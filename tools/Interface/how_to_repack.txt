How to re-pack view.jar

1. Extract all the java bytecode (.class files)
	* create a temporary directory
	* enter this directory and run: "jar xvf ../view.jar"

2. make your changes
	* add/remove the .class files or other ressources as necessary
	* edit the MANIFEST.MF file if necessary

3. Pack the files as described in the MANIFEST.MF file
	* from the directory that contains the manifest, run: "jar cvfm ../view.jar MANIFEST.MF *"
	* go up one directory and test that the jar file works: "java -jar ./view.jar"
	* then you can delete your temporary directory
