// Albedo:
- NOTE: In the radiation balance module the albedo is always the albedo from the top!
        In contrast, in SNOWPACK it is always the surface albedo, i.e. if there
        is snow below the canopy the snow albedo is used and printed out whereas
        in the radiation balance computation the canopy albedo is used.

// Meteo - Input :
- NOTE: Even if you use 2D-Meteo - Input make sure that the header in the 1D-Meteo - Input File is 
        convenient (the following is only an example but your layout should look similar!):
        Latitude=46.8332825          -------latitude and longitude are for the center of your model
        Longitude=9.8062515          -------domain ! They are used for the computation of the sun position.
        X_Coord=780605               -------swiss coordinates for the position of the radiation station
        Y_Coord=189629               -------swiss coordinates for the position of the radiation station
        Altitude=2693                -------altitude of the radiation station

-       meteo - input data always has to be in winter time (e.g. here in davos: UTC+1) 
-       and from an EXPOSED station at the mountain top
