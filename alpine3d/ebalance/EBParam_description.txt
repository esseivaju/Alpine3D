TERRAIN_RADIATION : 	-Use full terrain radiation calculation
			0: simple modelling (no terrain radiation)
			1: full modelling (with terrain radiation)
			--(default: 0)--

CLOUD : - Longwave sky radiation computation from
          0: longwave radiation measurement
          1: cloud cover observation
          --(default: 0)--

albedo: - adjustable albedo for the radiation balance module only,
          leave it as it is if you want to use the soil/snow albedos
          from the *.sno files resp. SNOWPACK parameterisation
        - for research purposes one might investigate incident
          radiation with different constant albedos or e.g. albedos
          depending on DHM height; to use this, watch out for the comments in
          'EnergyBalance::FillSurfaceData' class in "EnergyBalance.cc" !!
        - NOTE: in ebalance the albedo is always the albedo from the top!
          In contrast in SNOWPACK it is always the surface albedo, i.e. if there
          is snow below the canopy the snow albedo is used and printed out whereas
          in ebalance the canopy albedo is used.
          --(default: 0.8)--

store_vf: - Progressive Refinement iteration is used; but you can switch between
            0: view factors are not stored (in case of limited memory capacity i.e. large
               numbers of grid cells --> slower terrain radiation computation)
            and
            1: view factors are stored (in case of sufficient memory capacity --> faster
               terrain radiation computation)
            --(default: 1)--

read_vfsum: - in case of store_vf = 0 the view factor sum can be read from file to speed up the run
              1: read from file: product of sum of terrain view factors and surface area as well
                 as sky view factors; NOTE: the files have to be in the OUTPUT directory without
                 any header and have to be named "skyvf.txt" resp. "tvfarea.txt"! Both are obtained
                 by running the model one time step and by deleting the header in the output files
                 "geometry.skyvf" and "geometry.tvfarea" and renaming them accordingly...
                 Additionally, in "skyvf.txt"  the first line has to contain the sky view factor from
                 the specific sensor plane output : "specificgridcell_output.txt" in OUTPUT directory
                 but could of course be any number <= 1 if you are not interested on this point
              0: --(default: 0)--

sub_crit:  - substructuring threshold (in %) of the patches in the view factor computation --(default: 0.4)--
             note that mccluney(1994) proposes 0.1, i.e. for accurate view factors / radiation exchange
             computations a threshold of least 0.1 should be used

itEps_SW:  - stopping tolerance/iteration error for shortwave radiation --(default: 0.4)--
             (make it larger to stop the iteration earlier, i.e. less terrain reflections are
              included --> with 10 % (0.1) a good accuracy is obtained)

itEps1_SW: - stopping tolerance/iteration error for shortwave radiation --(default: 0.1)--
             (make it lower to stop the iteration earlier, i.e. less terrain reflections are
              included)

itEps_LW:  - stopping tolerance/iteration error for longwave radiation  --(default: 0.4)--
             note that two stopping critera are used

sw_radius: - the distance radius (in m) around each grid cell until which terrain reflection
             is taken into account --(default: 3000.)--

lw_radius: - the distance radius (in m) around each grid cell until which longwave emission
             is taken into account --(default: 1500. (Landl(2007)))--

/*    an additional specific grid cell plane for which the radiation is computed with an adjustable */
/*    height, location and inclination: in your OUTPUT-directory: specificgridcell_output.txt       */
/*    cf. README_FOR_RADIATIONBALANCE 								    */
s_i:      - grid cell number in x direction --(default: 1)--
s_j:      - grid cell number in y direction --(default: 1)--
s_sx:     - x normal vector component --(default: horizontal, i.e. 0)--
s_sy:     - y normal vector component --(default: horizontal, i.e. 0)--
s_offset: - dz offset (in m) (additional height ABOVE the ground/DHM height) --(default: 3)--

thresh_zero: - threshold for the zero value used for solar elevation comparison in rad --(default: 1.e-2)--
