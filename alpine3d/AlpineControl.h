/**
 * @page restarts Restarts
 * It is possible to regularly dump the exact status of each simulated pixel and then restart from a previously saved such backup.
 * In order to do so, it is necessary to enable writting out these status files, to copy them at the required timestep and then tell the model
 * to reread them when starting. These files are just regular SMET ".sno" files such as produced and used by Snowpack but for each simulated pixel. 
 * 
 * The following keys control this process, in the [Output] section:
 * 	+ SNOW_WRITE: is set to TRUE, enable writing these files;
 * 	+ SNOW_DAYS_BETWEEN: how many days between two updates to these files;
 *
 * On the command line, the switch "--restart" tells Alpine3D to read one file for each pixel instead of one file per land use class. Of course, all
 * the usual configuration keys for the "sno" files apply (see \ref reading_snow_files "reading snow files").
 * 
 * @note You MUST set the key "EXPERIMENT_NAME" in the [Output] section since this is used to name the files necessary for restarts
